== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the plugin free to use? =

The Snazzy Maps plugin is free to use for personal and open source projects. Business licenses are available for
single and multiple sites and can be purchased at https://snazzymaps.com/plugins

= How do I add a Google Map? =

This plugin does not add a Google Map to your page. It simply adds styles to your existing maps. If you haven't
added a map yet, search [WordPress Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins) for a suitable Google Map plugin.

= Snazzy Maps doesn't work with my Google Maps plugin! =

We've tested Snazzy Maps with several different Google Maps plugins. If you happen to find one that our plugin doesn't 
work with please send us an email at support@snazzymaps.com.

Also, the Snazzy Maps plugin cannot apply styles to maps created using the Google Maps Embed API. This is because of 
fundamental limitations on the way IFrames work on the web. We cannot access the map within Google's IFrame and cannot 
apply any styles to it. Sorry! Switching to a WordPress plugin that uses Google's JavaScript API will work instead.

= How can I access my favorites or private styles from SnazzyMaps.com? =

1. Sign up for an account at [SnazzyMaps.com](https://snazzymaps.com).
1. Click your email address in the top left corner.
1. Click the developer menu item on the left side.
1. Click the "Generate API Key" button.
1. Copy the long generated API Key.
1. Paste the key into the 'Settings' tab in the Snazzy Maps plugin.
1. You should now be able to access your favorites and private styles in the 'Explore' tab by changing the first filter dropdown.

== Screenshots ==
